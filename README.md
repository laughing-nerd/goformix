# Goformix

A lightweight and powerful form validation library designed for backend usage when parsing data from a JSON payload. It is still in development phase and is **not yet production ready**.

Goformix has not been tested yet. Suggestions and contributions are appreciated!

*P.S: I'll add an example implementation by today*
